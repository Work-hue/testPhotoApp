Task 1.1a 

The biggest difference between the pmf and the pdf is that the pmf depicts interval based probabilities while the pdf approximates
the probabilities over a continuum of sample points. The pdf can be seen as an upper envelope of the pmf given a particular dataset. As
the number of samples increases, the pdf takes on a more accurate upper envelope of the pmf. As the sample size increases,
the pmf and the pdf of the sampleset more closely resemble the pmf and pdf of the entire dataset.

Task 1.1b

Min of tabulate(X) = 0.003333%
Max of tabulate(X) = 0.003333%
Min of tabulate(floor(X)) = 0.000000%
Max of tabulate(floor(X)) = 5.490000%

Question 1:
Tabulate(X) gives an estimated pdf because the original dataset of all possible respiration rates is meant to be continuous.
Furthermore, tabulate(X) returns the probabilities representing the relative likelihood of all possible respiration rate values.
Tabulate (Y) gives a pmf because after using the floor function on X, all the possible respiration rates are truncated. This causes
the random variable to take on discrete values.

Question 2:
For the X dataset, the min and max probabilities are equal, because without the floor function, each respiration rate is distinct 
and therefore is as likely to appear as any other respiration rate. 
For the Y dataset, the min and max probabilities are not equal because with the floor function, all the values corresponding to the respiration 
rates are truncated. Hence, multiple respiration rates from the original data now share common Y values. Consequently, the frequency for each Y 
value can vary.

Question 3:
The probability that X will be contained in an interval of length  around the point a is approximately f(a).
If we let  be small enough such that each interval of length  only contains at most one sample, then each existing respiration rate value
corresponds to exactly one sample, which accounts for the reason that for the X dataset, the min and max probabilities are equal.
However, that is not true for PMF, since after taking Y = floor(X) in this case, necessarily some Y value could correspond to multiple samples.
Consequently, the frequency for each Y value can vary, and therefore for the Y dataset, the min and max probabilities are not equal.

Task 1.1c

Empirical a = 10.146654
Empirical b = 37.085962

Task 1.2a

Mean RESP = 21.741818
Standard Deviation RESP = 7.104292

Task 1.2c

The dataset generated in this part is normally distributed, but the dataset from 1.1
is right-skewed. In the dataset from 1.1, the variable X is approximately normally
distributed when 12 <= X <= 38, but not normally distributed when X<12 or X>38. 

Task 1.2d

PDF of normal distribution: 
f(x) = 1/(7.104292 * sqrt(2*Pi)) * exp(-0.5*((x-21.741818)/7.104292)^2) 
CDF of normal distribution: 
CDF does not have closed form, according to lecture slides.

Theoretical a = 7.142497
Theoretical b = 36.341138

Theoretical a and b are both a little bit less than the empirical a and b.
This is probably because our actual dataset from 1.1 is right-skewed, 
whereas a normal distribution is not skewed.

We all met up in Grainger basement on Mar 4 and worked through all of the tasks together.

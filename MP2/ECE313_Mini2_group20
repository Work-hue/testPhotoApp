Task 1.1a 

The biggest difference between the pmf and the pdf is that the pmf depicts interval based probabilities while the pdf approximates
the probabilities over a continuum of sample points. The pdf can be seen as an upper envelope of the pmf given a particular dataset. As
the number of samples increases, the pdf takes on a more accurate upper envelope of the pmf. As the sample size increases,
the pmf and the pdf of the sampleset more closely resemble the pmf and pdf of the entire dataset.

Task 1.1b

Min of tabulate(X) = 0.003333%
Max of tabulate(X) = 0.003333%
Min of tabulate(floor(X)) = 0.000000%
Max of tabulate(floor(X)) = 5.490000%
Observed Property of PDF: The integral of f(x) for all x is equal to 1.
